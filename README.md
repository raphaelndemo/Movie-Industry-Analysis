# Project Title
## Movie Market Analysis

## Overview
New company seeks to venture into movie industry by establishing its own movie studio although with no prior experience of film production and market strategy. The given project utilizes exploratory data analysis for insights to make better decisions. 

Based on historical data of Box Office Mojo, IMDb, TMDB, The Numbers, and Rotten Tomatoes, we performed high-level exploratory data analysis (EDA) to determine the tendencies of the box office performance, production budgets, and geographic distribution of revenue. This is aimed at translating these insights into practical, follow-up advice on the kind of films to create, which viewers are to reach, and how to find the right balance in placing resources.

The analysis is intentionally non-technical and business-focused, making the results accessible to stakeholders and suitable as a strategic foundation for launching a new movie studio.

## Business Understanding
The objective of this project is to support the company’s decision to launch a new movie studio by using data-driven insights. Specifically, this analysis aims to:
.To identify and prioritize genres based on revenue performance
.To determine audience ratings profiles to target 
.To analyze the effect of production cost to revenue
.To evaluate revenue distribution but geography to determine top performing regions

## Data Understanding and Analysis


## Conclusion

- Prioritize genres that consistently deliver large box office revenues for commercial-scale investments such as Animation,     Fantasy and Family films consistently generate the highest revenues. 

- Audience reception and rating is an important signal for commercial performance of genres.

- For investments, the new company should focus producing their movies in high-revenue regions which show consistent box office returns . This will be done through prioritizing marketing, distribution and content tailored to these audiences. Strategically, avoid low-revenue regions.

- Additionally, adapt movie genres based on what resonates in top-performing regions and can also consider co-production or partnerships in strong markets to minimize risks and maximize reach

- Investing in moderate-budget films may provide better risk-adjusted returns than consistently funding very high budget productions. That high-budget films don’t necessarily mean that the ROI will be high.
